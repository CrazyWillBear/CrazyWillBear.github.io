## Summary
This is my personal website, you can visit it [here](https://CrazyWillBear.github.io). It details my projects, methods of contacting me, and provides basic info about me. This is my first attempt at a website, so don't expect more than a minimalist small website!

## Process
Coded on [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) for live preview and auto-formatting. Exported to GitHub whenever necessary.
