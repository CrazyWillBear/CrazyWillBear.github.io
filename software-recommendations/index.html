			<li><b>Web Browsing</b></li>
			<p>
				Web browsing is crucial to the use of one's computer. Information, data, apps, and other important stuff is accessable only through the internet, and web browsers make this experience much easier.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brave</a></b></li>
			<p>
				Brave is a free, (mostly) open-source internet browser based in Chrome. It is simple, fast, and gives you free money (Brave Rewards).
			</p>
			</ul>
				<li><b>Text Editors</b></li>
			<p>
				Text editors are crucial to the usage of computers. From simply editing documents, to configuring programs, and coding itself. Text editors can make or break a good system.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neovim</a></b></li>
				<p>
					Neovim is free, open-source, and an improved version of the already amazing text editor Vim. It has the same plugin support, with a few other good features.
				</p>
					<li><b><a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vim</a></b></li>
				<p>
					Vim is free, open-source, and an improved version of Vi. Vim is slightly less bloated than Neovim, and depending on your needs, can actually be better.
				</p>
				<li><b><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notepad++</a></b></li>
				<p>
					If you're on Windows, nothing can beat the classic Notepad++. It is simple, easy to use, and extremely versatile.
				</p>
			</ul>
				<li><b>Terminal</b></li>
				<p>
					Terminals are crucial at least for Unix systems, as they are what help you interact with your computer on a deep level. Terminal emulators are used for speed and looks.
				</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitty</a></b></li>
				<p>
					Kitty is free and open-source. It is super fast and lightweight, and allows you to customize the fonts and colors with extreme ease. It's my terminal emulator of choice.
				</p>
					<li><b><a href="https://alacritty.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alacritty</a></b></li>
				<p>
					Alacritty is certainly a fan favorite, and is also free and open-source. However, Alacritty has trouble with customizing fonts and as a result is not my editor of choice. The large community however makes choosing a theme really easy and fun.
