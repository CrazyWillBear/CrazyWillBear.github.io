    <ul>
      <li><b>Web Browsing</b></li>
      <p>
        Web browsing is crucial to the use of one's computer. Information, data,
        apps, and other important stuff is accessable through web pages. A
        browser makes interacting with such pages much easier. A good web
        browser for me is one that is simple to use yet extremely customizeable.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://brave.com/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Brave</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Brave is a free, (mostly) open-source internet browser based in
          Chromium. It is customizeable, user-friendly, and comes with a ton of
          useful features.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Text Editors</b></li>
      <p>
        Text editors are crucial to the usage of computers. From simply editing
        documents, to configuring programs, and coding itself, text editors can
        make or break a good system. A good text editor is lightweight and
        versatile.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://neovim.io/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Neovim</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Neovim is free, open-source, and an improved version of the already
          amazing text editor Vim. It has the same plugin support, with a few
          features added on top.
        </p>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://www.vim.org/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Vim</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Vim is free, open-source, and an improved version of Vi. Vim is
          slightly less bloated than Neovim, and as a result can be considered
          better in some scenarios.
        </p>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Notepad++</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          If you're on Windows, nothing can beat the classic Notepad++. It is
          simple, easy to use, and extremely versatile.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Terminal</b></li>
      <p>
        Terminals are crucial (at least for UNIX systems), as they are what help
        you interact with your computer on a deep level. A good terminal
        emulator has speed, looks, and customizeability.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >kitty</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Kitty is free, open-source, fast, and lightweight. It allows you to
          customize the fonts and colors with extreme ease. It's my terminal
          emulator of choice.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Operating System</b></li>
      <p>
        Operating systems are the core of your system. In order to even use a
        computer, an operating system is required. A good operating system is
        fast, reliable, customizeable, and respects your privacy.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://artixlinux.org/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Artix Linux</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Artix Linux is my personal favorite Linux distro. It's based on Arch
          Linux (my previous favorite), and as a result is customizeable beyond
          belief, fast, lightweight, and simple. It's one advantage over Arch is
          that it doesn't use systemd (which is old and slow).
        </p>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://archlinux.org/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Arch Linux</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Arch Linux is one of the simplest Linux distros out there, and is
          considered a "classic" among Linux users. It's been around forever, is
          super customizeable, fast, lightweigt, and simple. The only issue is
          that it uses systemd, which is considered by modern standards to be
          slow and bloated (although it is still a really cool piece of
          software).
        </p>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://pop.system76.com/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Pop!_OS</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Pop!_OS is a beginner Linux distro based in Ubuntu. I vastly prefer it
          to Ubuntu because it has no spyware (unlike Ubuntu) and in my
          experience has been easier to use and more customizeable. It has all
          the advantages of using Linux, while being just as easy to use as
          MacOS or Windows.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Shells</b></li>
      <p>
        Shells are how you interact with applications and your computer as a
        whole. A high quality shell can make the difference between a shitty and
        amazing system.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://www.zsh.org/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >zsh</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          zsh is my shell of choice because it is super fast and for a few
          quality-of-life reasons. First of all, its autocomplete is much faster
          and functions like a drop down menu. zsh also follows POSIX standards
          more closely than Bash (which sets the standard for shells), as well
          as being super configurable (check out oh-my-zsh).
        </p>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Bash</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Bash is the most widely used shell in Linux and comes installed by
          default on many UNIX systems. It gets the job done, however with
          alternatives available, it isn't necessarily my first choice.
