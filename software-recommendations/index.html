    <ul>
      <li><b>Web Browsing</b></li>
      <p>
        Web browsing is crucial to the use of one's computer. Information, data,
        apps, and other important stuff is accessable only through the internet,
        and web browsers make this experience much easier.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://brave.com/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Brave</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Brave is a free, (mostly) open-source internet browser based in
          Chrome. It is simple, fast, and gives you free money (Brave Rewards).
        </p>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Text Editors</b></li>
      <p>
        Text editors are crucial to the usage of computers. From simply editing
        documents, to configuring programs, and coding itself. Text editors can
        make or break a good system.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://neovim.io/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Neovim</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Neovim is free, open-source, and an improved version of the already
          amazing text editor Vim. It has the same plugin support, with a few
          other good features.
        </p>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://www.vim.org/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Vim</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Vim is free, open-source, and an improved version of Vi. Vim is
          slightly less bloated than Neovim, and depending on your needs, can
          actually be better.
        </p>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Notepad++</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          If you're on Windows, nothing can beat the classic Notepad++. It is
          simple, easy to use, and extremely versatile.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Terminal</b></li>
      <p>
        Terminals are crucial at least for Unix systems, as they are what help
        you interact with your computer on a deep level. Terminal emulators are
        used for speed and looks.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >kitty</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Kitty is free and open-source. It is super fast and lightweight, and
          allows you to customize the fonts and colors with extreme ease. It's
          my terminal emulator of choice.
        </p>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://alacritty.org/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Alacritty</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Alacritty is certainly a fan favorite, and is also free and
          open-source. However, Alacritty has trouble with customizing fonts and
          as a result is not my editor of choice. The large community however
          makes choosing a theme really easy and fun.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Operating System</b></li>
      <p>
        Operating systems are the basis for any good computer. In order to use
        all the software above, you first need an operating system.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://artixlinux.org/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Artix Linux</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Artix Linux is my personal favorite Linux distro. It is a version of
          Arch Linux (my previous favorite). It is customizeable beyond belief,
          fast, lightweight, and simple. However, it has one advantage over
          Arch: it doesn't require the use of systemd (I actually use runit).
        </p>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://archlinux.org/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Arch Linux</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Arch Linux is one of the simplest and most "classic" Linux distros out
          there. It's been around forever, is super customizeable, fast, lightweigt,
          and simple. The only issue is that it uses systemd, which is considered
          by modern standards to be slow and bloated.
        </p>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://pop.system76.com/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Pop!_OS</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Pop!_OS is a beginner Linux distro based in Ubuntu. I vastly prefer it
          to Ubuntu simply because it has no spyware (unlike Ubuntu) and in my
          experience has been easier to use and more customizeable. It has all
          the advantages of using Linux, while being just as easy to use as
          MacOS or Windows.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Shells</b></li>
      <p>
        Shells are how you interact with applications and explore your computer.
        A high quality shell can make the difference between a shitty and
        amazing system.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://www.zsh.org/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >zsh</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          zsh is my shell of choice because it is super fast and for a few
          quality-of-life reasons. First of all, its autocomplete is much faster
          and functions like a drop down menu. zsh also follows POSIX standards
          more closely than Bash (which is considered the standard for shells),
          as well as being super configurable (check out oh-my-zsh).
        </p>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Bash</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Bash is the most widely used shell in Linux and comes installed by
          default on many Unix systems. It gets the job done, however with
          alternatives available, it isn't necessarily my first choice.
        </p>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a
              href="https://fishshell.com/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >fish</a
            ></b
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Fish is a pretty great shell, being that it's fast, colorful, has an
          awesome autocomplete system, and is in general pretty easy to use and
          install. However, it does not follow POSIX standards pretty much at
          all, and because of this you cannot run shell scripts.
