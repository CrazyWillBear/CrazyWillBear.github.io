    <h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux is an operating system kernel used to power
      computers around the world, from PCs to internet servers. Regardless of
      the purpose, Linux seems to find a way to remain useful and advantageous.
      The many distro (Linux distribution) choices, the open source code, and
      the passionate and informative community all culminate in an operating
      system experience that is unrivaled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows users, or otherwise average consumers, are
      often stuck with the operating system that comes preinstalled on their
      devices. Due to the fact that Microsoft strikes deals with computer
      manufacturers - which commits said manufacturers to preinstall Windows on
      the computers they produce - the average consumer is oftentimes exposed to
      Windows as their first operating system. Once someone becomes familiar
      with an operating system, it becomes difficult for them to switch and
      “relearn” how to use their computer(s). As a result, consumers often view
      switching operating systems as an inconvenience and not worthwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if one were to look further into the
      subject, the benefits become clear. The speed of Linux combined with its
      customizability provide for a convenient experience with performance far
      beyond Windows’. However, most importantly, Linux allows the user to
      actually own and control their computer. For example, Windows machines
      come with software that is pre-installed and sometimes irremovable such as
      Edge, Mail, Groove Music, Sticky Notes, Voice Recorder, Paint 3D, and even
      Candy Crush (no joke). On the vast majority of Linux distros, you choose
      what is installed and what isn’t. Even on distros that have pre-installed
      software, uninstallation of said software is as simple as one command.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h4 id="the-linux-terminal">The Linux Terminal</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Switching to Linux is often viewed as a scary and
      threatening task, mostly due to the emphasis on the terminal. For context,
      the terminal is the Linux equivalent of command prompt or PowerShell (in
      reality they are not even comparable, but this is the best example I can
      think of). The emphasis on the terminal is powerful, as almost every Linux
      distro essentially requires that you have at least a basic understanding
      of the terminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the necessity of the terminal differs
      from distro to distro, many beginner distros require less knowledge of the
      terminal (such as Ubuntu or PopOS). On said distros, there are tools in
      place to avoid the usage of the terminal completely. Installing apps can
      be done using the PopShop or .deb installers, and exploring files can be
      done using pre-installed file explorers. This user-friendly style allows
      for new Linux users to gradually become familiar with the terminal while
      using graphical tools that are familiar and intuitive.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h4 id="spyware">Spyware</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason that consumers should switch to
      Linux, is the endless tracking on the part of Microsoft (Apple and their
      operating system MacOS are also big offenders). There have been many
      instances of Microsoft being exposed for having implemented spyware in
      Windows. For example, according to the InstallGentoo Wiki (<a
        href="https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Windows_10#External_links"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >https://wiki.installgentoo.com</a
      >), “It was revealed that Microsoft sends encrypted images of the
      user&#39;s desktop back to [their headquarters].” To demonstrate the
      extent of the spying, The Hacker News (<a
        href="https://thehackernews.com/2016/02/microsoft-windows10-privacy.html"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >https://thehackernews.com</a
      >) did an experiment where they tracked their network activity on Windows
      to see what data was being sent where. “[The] idle Windows 10 box[system]
      had tried over 5,500 connections to 93 different IP addresses, out of
      which almost 4,000 were made to 51 different IP addresses belonging to
      Microsoft.” In other words, the Windows computer, sitting alone not being
      used, connected roughly 4,000 times to Microsoft’s servers. And this
      spying isn’t only limited to Microsoft, as the way the spying took place
      was less than secure. “Windows 10 expanded that connection to 113
      non-private IP addresses, potentially allowing hackers to intercept this
      data.” [their italics].
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should you care about Microsoft tracking you?
      Your computer is personal and contains private property. Allowing
      companies to access the data stored on your computer (which is private
      property) without your knowledge is plenty of reason to care. To draw a
      comparison, you wouldn’t like it if a car manufacturer sold you a car,
      then proceeded to constantly monitor where you traveled with it and who or
      what you traveled with. Why should that same ideology not apply to your
      computer?
    </p>

    <br />

    <h4 id="the-importance-of-privacy">The Importance of Privacy</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you think you couldn’t care less about
      people knowing what’s on your computer, I urge you to think twice. You are
      most likely storing valuable data on your computer(s) (such as financial
      information, private diaries or records, medical information, work
      resources, etc). These large companies are often perceived as faceless,
      but it’s important to understand that complete strangers have access to
      your private data, people that you might not want seeing it. Your property
      is on that computer, and it shouldn’t be turned over or exposed to random
      strangers. Furthermore, these companies use the data they collect to
      exploit users for money and power. Giving tech companies the power they
      desire is a terrible idea, and society as well as individual people are
      already facing the consequences (think of Facebook spreading conspiracy
      theories and/or Google selling your personal information).
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Linux, it is extremely rare for distros or
      companies to track your activity or spy on you. Since Linux is open source
      as well as the vast majority of its distros, spyware is easily snuffed out
      and often exposed publicly so you don’t have to worry. Even distros and
      software that have telemetry are often doing so only with the consent of
      the user (like Ubuntu, who has opt-in telemetry).
    </p>

    <br />

    <h4 id="price">Price</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides all the technical benefits of using Linux,
      there are economic incentives as well. The Linux kernel itself is open
      source and thus free to use. As a result, the vast majority of Linux
      distros are free or have optional pricing. This starkly contrasts with
      Windows, which costs upwards of $130. MacOS is in a similar situation,
      where using the operating system is only allowed on Apple computers which
      are notoriously expensive (although in theory you can install MacOS onto
      any computer using various techniques). Besides the cost of the operating
      system itself, due to the Linux community’s emphasis on free software,
      there are a ton of alternatives to expensive software available on Linux
      that cost nothing to install and use. Overall, using Linux turns out to be
      much cheaper than Windows or MacOS.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is one thing you should take away from
      this, it’s that Linux distros are, in general, better than Windows. Better
      of course meaning more privacy, security, performance, and
      customizability, but with less bloated and unnecessary software. Making
      the switch can feel risky and inconvenient, but I assure you that beyond
      the initial switch comes all the benefits of using Linux over Windows.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge everyone who uses Windows to think more
      deeply than “It’s a lot to learn” or “I don’t care if they track me”. Do
      you really think that, or are you making excuses so you can in good
      conscience avoid the inconvenient switch? All I ask is that you research
      more and think deeper about your values and priorities.
    </p>

    <h2 id="beginner-s-guide-">Beginner’s Guide:</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, choose a beginner distro. I
      recommend PopOS, it is a fork of Ubuntu with the telemetry (spyware)
      removed and other unnecessary tools removed or improved. It allows users
      to do all necessary tasks without the terminal, but requires the user to
      learn how to use the terminal in order to perform more complex tasks. This
      structure allows the user to learn and grow with their computer, and
      eventually come away with significant knowledge of the Linux terminal. On
      top of that, PopOS is faster and easier to install than Windows, and is
      significantly less bloated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you become confused or are stuck trying to do
      something, reference the ArchWiki (<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org"
        >https://wiki.archlinux.org</a
      >), as this advice applies to the majority of Linux distros. Finally, I
      recommend that once you become comfortable with PopOS, you research other
      distros and switch to a more difficult and customizable distro. It will
      help you learn way more about Linux and allow you to customize your Linux
      install much more than on PopOS. Some other distros I recommend are Arch,
      Fedora, Debian, and if you so dare, Gentoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most distros have their own communities as well as
      websites with wikis, which should help you on your journey. If you ever
      need advice, I recommend you ask on Reddit or Discord for help, as some
      privately run websites are known for being jerks to new Linux users (this
      is a minority of the Linux community).
